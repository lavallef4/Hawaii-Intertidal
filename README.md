Spatial and temporal patterns in Hawaiʻi’s intertidal: Decadal changes in benthic community composition

Submitted to Marine Biology June 26, 2019

The “Spatial Analysis Data” csv file contains survey data from nine intertidal sites used in the spatial analysis (Table 1 of manuscript). Metadata columns include survey ID, date on which the survey was conducted, site name (GPS coordinates provided in Table 1 of manuscript), island, wind/wave exposure type in which the site is located (i.e., windward, leeward, bay, or channel), and substrate type  (L = limestone, B = basalt, M = mixed limestone and basalt). The remaining columns correspond to taxa identified on the surveys, with algae listed first, followed by invertebrates. The values in these columns are the mean percent cover of the respective taxon across all quadrats on a given survey, recorded using the point-intercept method.

The “Temporal Analysis Data” file contains survey data from five intertidal sites used in the temporal analysis (Table 2 of manuscript). Metadata columns include survey ID, date on which the survey was conducted, month, decade and year in which the survey was conducted (decade A indicates 2006–2007 and decade B indicates 2016–2017), and site name. The remaining columns correspond to taxa identified on the surveys. The values in these columns are the mean percent cover of the respective taxon across all quadrats on a given survey, recorded using the point-intercept method.
